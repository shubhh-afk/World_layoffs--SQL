# World Layoffs Data Cleaning with MySQL

This repository documents my personal exploration of data cleaning techniques using MySQL. 
I focused on cleaning a raw dataset of world layoffs to enhance my understanding of SQL and data manipulation within a relational database.

**Key Activities:**

*   **Data Loading and Transformation:** Imported raw data into a MySQL table and performed initial data transformations.
*   **Duplicate Handling:** Identified and removed duplicate entries within the dataset.
*   **Data Standardization:** Standardized data formats, such as converting date columns to the appropriate data type.
*   **Null Value Handling:** Addressed missing values by either removing rows with null values in critical columns or implementing strategies to fill in missing data.
*   **Column Management:** Selected and removed relevant columns based on the analysis objectives. 

**Learning Outcomes:**

*   Gained practical experience with core MySQL commands (e.g., `CREATE TABLE`, `INSERT`, `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `ALTER TABLE`).
*   Developed a foundational understanding of data cleaning principles within a relational database environment.
*   Improved my SQL scripting skills by creating a basic script to automate the data cleaning process.

This project provided valuable insights into the challenges and best practices of data cleaning using MySQL. 
I plan to continue exploring more advanced data cleaning techniques and expanding my knowledge of SQL in future projects.
